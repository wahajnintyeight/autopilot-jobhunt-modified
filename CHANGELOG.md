## [Unreleased]

### Added
- CI hardening: Python 3.13 in the test matrix, pip caching, and a `gitleaks`
  secret-scan job.
- Formal test scaffold: `pytest.ini` and a shared `conftest.py` (`fake_llm`,
  `clean_env`, `sample_config`, `sample_job` fixtures).
- GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request).
- `skills/autopilot-jobhunt/SKILL.md` — a Claude Code usage skill that drives the hunt
  via the MCP tools.
- MCP registry manifests: `server.json` (official MCP Registry) and `smithery.yaml`.
- `autopilot mcp` subcommand to launch the stdio MCP server from the installed console
  script.
- `SECURITY.md`, `PRIVACY.md`, and this `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [0.4.0]

### Added
- `glama.json` for Glama MCP ownership/indexing and a Glama quality badge.
- `Dockerfile` and OCI image labels for the Glama MCP listing and ghcr package linking.
- Demo GIF and star CTA in the README.
- `LOG_LEVEL` env honored for console verbosity.

### Changed
- Scanner always saves results to CSV and logs a provider-aware startup line.

## [0.3.1]

### Fixed
- Compose `config.json` and `.env` correctly (placeholder guard so the default `.env`
  template no longer clobbers real config values).
- `export` works without API keys (reads local scan state only).
- Added per-request timeouts to OpenRouter and Anthropic calls.
- Handle both dict and list JSON shapes from the Claude CLI output.

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- `claude_cli` LLM provider (score/draft via the local `claude` CLI, no API key).

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- pip-install workflow with `autopilot init` scaffolding.
- Structured logging and CSV fallback when Telegram send fails.
- Anthropic/Claude as an optional LLM provider.
- `SETUP.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

### Changed
- Renamed the package and repository to `autopilot-jobhunt`.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial open-source release: nightly careers-page scan, LLM resume scoring,
  Telegram alerts, and on-demand resume + cover-letter drafting.
